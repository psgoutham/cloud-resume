# Cloud Resume Challenge
This project is part of the Cloud Resume Challenge, a hands-on initiative designed to demonstrate foundational cloud skills by building and deploying a personal resume site using cloud-native technologies. The challenge spans front-end development, cloud infrastructure, CI/CD, and infrastructure-as-code practices.


# Goal of the project
The goal is to showcase not only a working static website hosted on AWS, but also the behind-the-scenes automation, scalability, and reliability of modern DevOps workflows â€” all while gaining real-world experience with AWS services.
